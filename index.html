                      Orion’s story begins with the ending of most fairy tales; a prince and princess-of-sorts- falling in love with one another. His mother enraptured his father with her singing ability and swift movements, her role as a leading lady in a musical theater troupe. The opening night show in Horai led to their first meeting; a ninja from the town hired as their security suddenly turned into a secret lover. It wasn’t long before the whispers and touches turned to something more... and Orion soon became the bundle of joy his parents dreamed of. <br><br>Followed by the birth of his younger sister, the pair of them grew up with a strict but loving presence, the watchful eye of their father instilling them with values of integrity, self-discipline, and patience. All the while, his mother embossed her love, care and generosity; ensuring her children felt every bit as adored as they were. Orion’s mother was his everything, his childlike eyes looking up in wonder as she would share bedtime stories, teach him to bake cookies, and all manner of things that made him inseparable from her. Although he appreciated the teachings from his father (especially the self-defense), part of him wanted to spit in the face of the rigid routine, to at least be free to choose his own path. <br><br>At the age of 16, his mother died. He remembers the exact day in excruciating memory; the flashing lights, the paramedics, the stench of the hospital. It lingers on his consciousness like a leech. The sight of Rune crying as they wheel the person he loved the most in this world away, while his father stands emotionless. Unmoving. The resentment grew like a virus, Orion becoming more and more distant from his remaining family, the fights more and more frequent as he festered a bittersweet grudge against his own father. He should have- could have done more to protect her- so why didn’t he?!<br><br>As their fights come to a head, Orion receives his letter from Night Raven College- a freedom ticket! His only regret might be leaving behind his little sister… but being a daddy’s girl, she can surely fend for herself. Taking a deep breath, Orion clasps the letter in both hands, before stepping into the carriage awaiting him; never giving his father one last look.

                      Stumbling into his dorm room after a long, boring day of classes, the Diasomnia third-year brushes his charcoal bangs from his face, tossing his satchel of textbooks onto the messy bed before retrieving a slim stack of letters from a pocket in his blazer. They’re crumpled, disheveled; clearly not an item of any importance, but instead one of entertainment. It wasn’t uncommon for Orion to receive letters from admirers. In fact, it was a normal occurrence, his suave nature winning over far too many. Unfortunately for them, they were nothing more than playthings to him. <br><br>He whistles as he sits at his desk, strewn with unfinished homework, more letters, and guitar picks, and pushes it all to one side. The stack hits the wood with a satisfying, dull <em>thud</em>, and he quickly gets to work on shelling them open with his beloved pocket dagger. <br><br><em>To my beloved Orion:</em><br><Br>
                      Hah-! The laugh is involuntary, but for anyone to call him their beloved when they barely know him is truly comical. He rocks back on the chair, smirking as he reads the rest. There’s little value in the way of entertainment here. Just a girl and her sweet feelings with the innocent audacity to think they’ll be returned. The fireplace bursts to life as it swallows the letter whole.<br><br>
                      <em>”Poor dear…”</em> He mutters to no one, suddenly stone-faced as he glares at the amber embers, <em>”Maybe it’d be best to get attached to someone who actually has a chance of returning your feelings.” </em><br><br>
                      Returning to the stack, he shuffles through the identical confessions with boredom before suddenly pausing in shock. A familiar family wax stamp seals the letter closed, and he flips it over quickly to reveal his dorm address in loopy, cursive writing he knows like the back of his hand. The letter is torn open with abandon, hands stuttering as he unfolds the paper. His heart pounds against the cage of his chest. <em>Rune…</em>

                      <span class="p">Orion’s soft black hair frames his eyes perfectly, bangs parted in one side. He also sports an undercut, and may be seen pinning stray strands of hair out of his face during guitar practice or late night gaming sessions. He sports various ear piercings, always wears one of his mothers necklaces, and takes his fashion sense (or lack thereof) from punk subcultures in Horai. </span><span class="p">Sharp, slender eyes frame gorgeous hazelnut irises, soft lips and a sharp jawline only aiding his alluring image. Orion stands at around 5”8, and has a slim, slightly athletic build. His arms, legs, and stomach are visibly a little toned due to the years of training. </span><br>

He may also implant commands of his own, provided their mental fortitude is weak enough. The afflicted will have full memory of their actions, and be entirely conscious. However, they will fail to remember why they acted on these desires, or why they obeyed such sudden thoughts. People with higher mental thresholds or those who have practiced mind protection magic will find it harder to be afflicted.<br><Br>Orion may only use his Unique Magic on one person at a time, due to the high blot accumulation. The afflicted must act out his wishes before the spell is lifted.<br><br>In order to activate his Unique Magic, Orion must make eye contact with the subject, and utter his UM title. This may be done from any distance, provided the eye contact is there. His commands may be given vocally or telepathically.</p>
